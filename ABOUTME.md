I'm Humberto Kentish
Something about me is that I am from Panama, I am 19 years old, I play basketball and I speak English, my first language is Spanish. I like video games and technology. I think this is the source of my interest or taste for studying computer science.
Why am I interested in coding? The first reason is that I want to know the core or source from which, for example, a social network, a video game or security software is created. I love the process of using programming languages ​​to give instructions to a computer. I know it is hard, but at the same time I really enjoy solving a technological problem, for example if the code I inserted gave me an error. And this is a short summary of why I like to code because it powers the websites, software and applications that people use every day.
